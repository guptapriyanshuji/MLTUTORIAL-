    "1). SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING - YOU HAVE TWO TYPES OF DIFFERENT PROBLEM STATEMENT ONE IS CLASSIFICATION AND ANOTHER ONE IS REGRESSION.\n",
    "IN SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING THE DATASET THAT IS SPECIFICALLY THAT IS GIVEN TO YOU . IN THIS DATA SET YOU HAVE SPECIFIC OUTPUT AND YOUR ENTIRE MODEL IS BASICALLY TRAINED TO PREDICTS THE OUTPUT SO MODEL WILL BE BASICALLY TRAINED WITH SOME DATA WITH SOME INPUT DATA AND SOME OUTPUT DATA LATER ON MODEL WHENEVER ITS GETS THE INPUT DATA PREDICTING THE OUTPUT DATA \n",

IT WILL FIRST APPLY  CLUSTERING ALGORITHM TO FIND WHICH REGION ITS BELONG TO AND BASED ON THE REGION THEN  WE PASS TO THE PREDICTION MODEL  WHICH IS SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING MODEL \n",
