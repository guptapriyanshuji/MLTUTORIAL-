AI VS ML VS DL VS DS 
AI IS BASICALLY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. AI IS A SMART APPLICATION THAT CAN PERFORM  ITS OWN TASK WITHOUT ANY HUMAN INTERVATION EXAMPLE SELF DRIVING CAR, ROBOTS.

ML IS A SUBSET OF AI. IT PROVIDES STATS TOOLS TO LEARN 
ANALYZE, VISUALIZE, AND DEVELOPED PREDECTIVE MODEL FROM THE DATA. EXAMPLE SHOPING IN AMAZON,WATCHED MOVIE IN NETFLEX - RECOMMANDATION SYSTEM.

DEEP LEARNING IS A SUBSET OF MACHINE LEARNING. MAIN AIM IS TO BE MEMMIC HUMAN BRAIN. BECAUSE OF THIS . THE SCIENTIST INN 1950'S  THOUGHT CAN BE MACHINE BEING  LEARN , HOW HUMAN BEING LEARN. BECAUSE OF THIS THERE WAS
CREATED SOMETHING MULTILAYER NEURAL NETWORK. BEACUSE OF THIS MULTILAYER NEURAL NETWORK YOU ARE ABLE TO SEE MANY  MANY APPLICATION . EXAMPLE OBJECT DETECTION , IMAGE RECOGNAIZATION, CHATBOT, CHATGPT. 

IN DATASCIENCE ALL THE THREE THINGS ARE COVERED 



TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING 
1) SUPERVISED LEARNING 
2) UNSUPERVISED LEARNING 
3) SEMISUPERVISED LEARNING 
4) REINFORCEMENT 

1). SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING - YOU HAVE TWO TYPES OF DIFFERENT PROBLEM STATEMENT ONE IS CLASSIFICATION AND ANOTHER ONE IS REGRESSION.
IN SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING THE DATASET THAT IS SPECIFICALLY THAT IS GIVEN TO YOU . IN THIS DATA SET YOU HAVE SPECIFIC OUTPUT AND YOUR ENTIRE MODEL IS BASICALLY TRAINED TO PREDICTS THE OUTPUT SO MODEL WILL BE BASICALLY TRAINED WITH SOME DATA WITH SOME INPUT DATA AND SOME OUTPUT DATA LATER ON MODEL WHENEVER ITS GETS THE INPUT DATA PREDICTING THE OUTPUT DATA 

EXAMPLE IN CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM LET SAY I HAVE SPECIFIC DATA SET 

PLAYHOURS   STUDYHOURS    PASS/FAIL- OUTPUT FEATURE= DEP
8            2                FAIL 
7            3                FAIL 
3            7                PASS 

HERE FIXED NUMBER OF VALUES 
 
REGRESSION EXAMPLE 
SIZEOF HOUSE             NO OF ROOMS            PRICE 
100M                      3                     456789

VALUES ARE CONTINEUS 

2) UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING - IN UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING YOU DONT HAVE SPECIFIC ANY OUTPUT AS  SUCH AS. YOU JUST HAVE DATASET. FOR THIS DATASET  YOU NEED TO FORM CLUSTERS OR SIMILAR GROUPS
EXAMPLE CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION 
 I OWN SHOPING WEBSITE LET SAY WITH RESPECT TO SHOPING WEBSITE  I HAVE SOME CUSTOMER DATA CUSTOMER DATA IS BASED ON SALARY AND EXPENDETURE. 

3) SEMISUPERVISED LEARNING - THIS IS A COMBINATION OF SUPERVISED LEARNING AND UNSUPERVISED LEARNING. 
INITALLY MODEL WILL BE TRAINED WITH SUPERVISED DATA SET
LATER IT WILL BE MADE IN THE FORM OF CLUSTERING 

EXAMPLE - NETFLEX IT HAS RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM IT WILL HAVE SO MANY MODEL  BASED ON THE REGIONS SO WHAT WILL BE DO FIRST. IT WILL FIRST APPLY  CLUSTERING ALGORITHM TO FIND WHICH REGION ITS BELONG TO AND BASED ON THE REGION THEN  WE PASS TO THE PREDICTION MODEL  WHICH IS SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING MODEL 


4) REINFORCEMENT LEARNING - REINFORCEMENT LEARNING IS AN AREA OF MACHINE LEARNING CONCERNED WITH HOW INTELLIGENT AGENTS OUGHT TO TAKE ACTIONS IN AN ENVIRONMENT IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE NOTION OF CUMULATIVE REWARD. 
REINFORCEMENT LEARNINIG IS ONE OF THREE BASIC MACHINE LEARNING PARADIGMS, ALONGSIDE SUPERVISED LEARNING AND UNSUPERVISED LEARNING. 

EXAMPLE The problem is as follows: We have an agent and a reward, with many hurdles in between. The agent is supposed to find the best possible path to reach the reward. The following problem explains the problem more easily.  


DATA SET , WE USUALLY DIVIDE DATASET INTO THREE PARTS BEFORE WE SPECIFICALLY WE TRAINED OUR MODEL FOR FURTHER PREDICTION. 
1. TRAINING DATASET 
TRAINING DATASET IS SPECIFICALLY USED  TO TRAIN THE MODEL. WE WILL USE TRAINING DATASET TO TRAIN THE MODEL 

2.VALIDATION DATASET - WITH THE HELP OF VALIDATION DATASET WE SPECIFICALLY PERFORM HYPER PARAMETER TUNIG OF THE MODEL SO WE SPECIFICALLY USED SOMETHING AS VALIDATION DATASET 
HYPER PARAMETER TUNIG MEANS WE WANT TO TUNE AND TUIC PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL  SO THAT MODEL ACCURACY IS INCREASES FOR THAT PURPOSE WE SPECIFICALLY USED VALIDATION DATASET 

3. TESTING DATASET- WE SPECIFICALLY TEST THE MODEL AND WE SEE THAT THE MODEL CAN PERFORM WITH ACCURACY 

MY MODEL WILL NEVER NO THE TEST DATASET 

EXAMPLE  TRAINIG-BOOKS = QUESTION AND ANSWER WE PREPARE FOR EXAM , DIFFERENT BOOKS WE LEARN MORE QUESTION ITS LIKE A TUNNING , EXAM - TEST DATA = IN EXAM WE GET QUESTION PAPER THIS WILL TEST OUR BRAIN I GET 80% IT WILL BE MY SCORE 
1)MODEL PERFORMANCE 
2)OVERFITING , UNDEFITING 
3)BIAS VS VARIANCE 


1)OVERFITING AND UNDERFITING 

TRAIN = MODEL IS TRAINED = ACCURACY 95% EX-BOOK 
TEST = MODEL IS TEST = ACCURACY  65%   EX-EXAM PAPER 
{LOW BIAS, HIGH VARIANCE}
  

NOW THIS TYPE OF SCENERIO BASICALLY HERE IS OVERFITTING
WITH RESPECT TO MY TRAINING DATASET MY MODEL HAS TRAINED SO WELL THAT WILL GIVE ACCURCAY SOME WHERE ARROUND IS 95% FOR THAT KIND OF DATASET BUT FOR NEWER DATSET WHICH IS PRESENT IN THE TEST IS GIVING A LOWER ACCURACY 

OVERFITTING CONDITION INDICATES => LOW BIAS & HIGH VARIANCE 

BIAS - IN THE TRAIN DATASET , IF THE ACCURACY IS HIGH- LOW BIAS  , IF THE ACCURACY IS LESS - HIGH BIAS , 
IN THE TEST DATA ACCURACY IS LOW THEN IT IS HIGH VARIANCE . IF THE ACCURACY IS HIGH THEN IT IS LOW VARIANCE 

TRAIN = ACCURACY 65% 
TEST = ACCURACY 55% 
{HIGH BIAS, HIGH VARIANCE} 

THIS KIND OF SCENERIO IS UNDERFITTING 
MY MODEL IS NOT AT ALL TRAINED WELL RESPECT TO TRAIN DATASET SO ACCURACY IS LESS WITH THE RESPECT OF NEW TEST DATA MY MODEL ALWAYS WILL FAIL 
FROM BOOKS I DID NOT LEARN PROPERLY FOR EXAM I DIRECTLY WENT AND WRITE DOWN MY EXAM OBIOUSLY I DID NOT GET GOOD MARKS . 

GENERALIZED MODEL 
TRIAN => ACCURACY 86% 
TEST => ACCURACY 85%
{LOW BIAS, LOW VARIANCE}

YOUR TRAINING ACCURACY WITH RESPECT TO WITH RESPECT TO TRAIN DATASET YOUR ACCURACY SHOULD BE HIGH AND YOUR TEST ACCURACY  SHOULD ALSO BE HIGH WHENEVER YOU HAVE THIS SCENERIO THAT BASICALLY MEANS {LOWS BIAS AND LOW VARIANCE} YOUR ERROR RATE IS LESS . THIS IS WHAT SHOULD OUR AIM AS A DATASCIENTIST  TO BRING THE MODEL IN THIS, MY TRAINING ACCURACY SHOULD ALSO BE GOOD MY TEST ACCURACY SHOULD ALSO GOOD
